You are a god, visiting the realm of humans. What will you tell them?

I made a small single-player larp during a two hour game jam. The first prototype was made with strips of paper ripped out of my notebook, so I decided to make a printable version so that other people could try it out!

I have kept most of the writing exactly as the original prototype, so all kinds of feedback, both on writing and design, is much appreciated.

Here it is:

Enjoy!
