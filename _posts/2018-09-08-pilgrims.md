Pilgrims is a social board game for 2 - 10 players who take on the role of pilgrims completing a 800 km journey from St Jean Pied de Port in France to Santiago de Compostela in Spain. 

![The game box of Pilgrims, slightly open. The front of the box has the Pilgrims logo, the word Pilgrims in a fancy script, the tagline 'A social game about growth and discovery', and five hexagonal shapes in different colours forming a path. Across the path are black footprints. Underneath the game box lies the game instructions, and to the right lies a stack of rectangular cards and another stack of hexagonal cards. The rectangular cards have five hexagons in the same colours as the game box, as well as text next to it, to blurry to read. The top hexagonal card says 'Lagrono' and 'Leapfrog over the nearest Pilgrim!'.](/uploads/2018/09/20/pilgrims-boxandcards.png)

The game is based on a real pilgrimage undertaken by several hundred thousand people each year called the Camino de Santiago. In 2015, [Matt](https://matthewdeline.com/) walked the Camino and wanted to share the experience he had with people who are unable to go on the Camino themselves. However, he found it difficult to express in words or pictures his meetings with people and the feeling of togetherness with people who elsewhere would just be absolute strangers.

Together with Tommy Graven, we decided to tell the story through the medium of a game. In Pilgrims, players get to experience that feeling of meeting people on a common journey, brought together because theyâ€™re doing something apart from normal life.
