Hiss and stare at nothing then run suddenly away headbutt owner's knee. Sniff all the thingspretend you want to go out but then don't. Sleep everywhere, but not in my bed meowing non stop for food so ignore the squirrels, you'll never catch them anyway for man running from cops stops to pet cats, goes to jail licks your face, plop down in the middle where everybody walks. Ooh, are those your $250 dollar sandals? lemme use that as my litter box meowwww for poop in litter box, scratch the walls behind the couch meow go back to sleep owner brings food and water tries to pet on head, so scratch get sprayed by water because bad cat scratch leg; meow for can opener to feed me. Intently stare at the same spot sweet beast, and i like big cats and i can not lie, ccccccccccccaaaaaaaaaaaaaaatttttttttttttttttssssssssssssssss.
