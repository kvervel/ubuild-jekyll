I recently started playing Dungeons and Dragons, and as much as I love slaying dragons and kicking butt in a fictional world of wonder, filling out character sheets quickly became a dreaded part of the game. Me and the default character sheets just don't connect... On a personal level.

Enter: a character sheet with reasonably sized boxes, an equipment list that will actually fit your character's equipment, cute lineart and more. I am very happy with the result!

If you want a pdf version of the character sheet, just drop me a line at [jorid(at)jonland.io](mailto:jorid@jonland.io)!
